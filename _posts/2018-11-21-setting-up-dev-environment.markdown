First off, I'd just like to thank Antonio for getting me started on the likes of `vim` back in my Attache days, else it would be the maddest struggle to get me started on this little project of mine...

So getting this project started needed some planning. Overall I had a general idea of:

- Read about Jekyll
- Get a build going locally in an environment (preferablly linux)
- Read about GitHub Pages
- Try and push a local Jekyll app onto GitHub Pages
- Make a first post and push it live

That being said, there was so much prerequisite knowledge I needed to have to get me through it all, including just the setup to help me get there end-to-end.

Such as:
- Bash
- Linux
- Vim
- Git
- Markdown
- Ruby <-- this was a new one
- HTML

And then there was the troubleshooting...
- Pulling a new repo from git and rebasing it onto an existing local repo
- Updating the gem bundles threw an exception for the `nokogiri` gem

But thank goodnesss for stackoverflow!

So now its up, live on [ltbrujahh.github.io][blog-url]! Which I should probably change URL at some point...

which means buying a domain,
and choosing a name,
and finding a cheap provider,
... do I want .com or .com.au?

Exciting times!

So thats my next TODO pretty much.

And I also need to figure out how whether I want to stick to using `vim` or `vscode`, but that means I need to setup the environment for Windows instead of Linux which *apparently* isn't quite good for Ruby development. Ah well at least I can practise my `vi` skills!

**#EDIT**: My goodness do you know how long it took me to figure out how to escape a hashtag?!
